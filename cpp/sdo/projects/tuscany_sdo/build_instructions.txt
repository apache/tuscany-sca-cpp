Tuscany SDO Build Instructions
===============================

The project is dependent on libxml 
(available here: http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html) 

The versions required are these:
	Hydra.sdo.build\libxml2-2.6.19.win32
	Hydra.sdo.build\iconv-1.9.1.win32
	Hydra.sdo.build\zlib-1.2.2.win32

By default, the projects are set up to look for these in a directory
called  tuscany\cpp\sdo\dependencies, but you can put them anywhere you
like if you alter the project settings for extra includes and link input. 
You would also have to alter the final copy which copies the dlls out to bin.
or the projects need to be altered to look whereever you put these files..

Open the build workspace tuscany\cpp\sdo\runtime\projects\tuscany_sdo\tuscany_sdo.dsw

Build->Set Active Configuration->sdo_runtime - Win32 Release

Build->Rebuild All

The output of the build will be in runtime\core\Release.

The executable ,required headers and lib are copied to tuscany\cpp\sdo\bin, include and lib.
