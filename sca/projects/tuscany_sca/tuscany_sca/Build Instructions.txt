Tuscany SCA Build Instructions
==============================

1) Set the environment variable TUSCANY_SDOCPP to the path of an SDO driver

2) Set the environment variable AXIS2_HOME to the path of Axis2C (Version 0.92)

NOTE: The environment variables must be set BEFORE launching Visual Studio

The output for the build will be in tuscany\cpp\sca\include, lib and bin

To run the test from a command prompt:

1) Set the environment variable TUSCANY_SCACPP to the location of the built SCA
   (...tuscany\cpp\sca\deploy)

2) Add %TUSCANY_SCACPP%\lib and %TUSCANY_SDOCPP%\lib to the PATH
   (ensure required libraries for SDO are also on the path. e.g. libxml2)

3) cd %TUSCANY_SCACPP%\..\projects\tuscany_sca\tuscany_sca_test\Debug

4) tuscany_sca_test

NOTE: To run the test from the workspace the environment variables must be set 
      BEFORE launching Visual Studio
