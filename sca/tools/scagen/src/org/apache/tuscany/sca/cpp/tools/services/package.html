<h1>Overview</h1>



<p>This package contains classes that generate C++ wrappers and
proxies for C++ implementations of SCA services. </p>

<h2>What the package does</h2>

<p>The Scagen class main method will take in an input and
output directory name. The input directory is taken to be the SCA composite root
directory.  The tool will generate the wrapper and proxy headers and methods
bodies in the output directory. </p>

<p>These proxies and wrappers enable the SCA for C++ runtime to
act as a conduit for SCA C++ calls in a type free manner. Client code can call
the type specific functions that are in the generated proxy classes. The call
is marshalled into a generic format and a SCA for C++ runtime function with a
standard signature is invoked. The details of the call are passed as data. </p>

<p>On the other end of the runtime, a generated function with a
standard signature is called, this function will inspect the data that
represents the call’s method name and call the appropriate type specific
function in the C++ implementation. </p>

<h2>The Input Data Used</h2>

<p>The input directory passed to the Scagen method is taken to
be the SCA composite root directory. All the sca.composite and .fragment files in
that directory are inspected to resolve all the &lt;component/&gt; elements
within them. </p>

<p>Each &lt;component/&gt; element found is inspected to see if
it has a &lt;implementation.cpp/&gt; element within it. </p>

<p>Each &lt;implementation.cpp/&gt; element should have a
header attribute that represents a C++ header file that contains function
prototypes for the C++ implementation of the service. An optional class
attribute can be used to select one class if more than one that is present in
the header file. The default class is the one with the same name as the header
file. The tool will verify that the implementation header contains an
appropriate class prototype. </p>



<p>The directory that contains the implementation header should
also contain a matching .componentType file for the equivalent SCA component. So
for example, a MyServiceImpl.h file would have a corresponding MyServiceImpl.componentType
file in the same directory. </p>



<p>Each componentType file is inspected for &lt;service/&gt;
and &lt;reference/&gt; elements. For each &lt;service/&gt; element that is
found that contains a &lt;interface.cpp/&gt; element within it,</p>

<p>the header attribute of the &lt;interface.cpp/&gt; is taken
as the filename of the C++ interface header for the SCA service.  This C++
header file is opened and used as a means for specifying the SCA service
resulting in an appropriate wrapper and proxy being generated for this service
interface. Both method bodies and headers are generated in the given output
directory. The processing of a &lt;reference/&gt; element is the same except
that only a proxy header and implementation are generated. </p>





<h2>Outline Design: How it Works</h2>



<p>The basic approach is to scan in the XML files by first
creating a DOM document tree of them and then recursively rifling through the DOM 
with some generic code in the XMLFileActorClass by default this processing will
build up a map which maps the XPath location of attributes to their values.
Additionally subclasses can add to a “handlers map” which maps from the name of
a particular element to an object that implements the DomNodeHandler interface.
If the XMLFileActor code comes across any element that has an equivalent handler
in the handler map the objects handleNode method will be called. </p>

<p>Typically the DomNodeHandler’s handle node interface will
use XPath to pull out the parameters that it is interested in from the
parameters map that is being built up by the generic code. </p>

<p>This design was chosen as the Java level specified for the
original implementation did not have direct XPath query of XML data but it was
known that this would be available in Java 1.5 onwards. The design allows the
DOM and parameters map handling to be replaced in the future with JRE 1.5 code
with less impact on the rest of the code.</p>



<p>The processing leads to the parsing of the C++ interface
files using the org\apache\tuscany\sca\cpp\tools\common package. This results
in a Headers object</p>

<p>that contains a List of Signature objects, each one
representing a function prototype found in the header. </p>



<p>We are aiming to get all the semantic data we want to use
into a DOM document (this represents the model of our input data) and then use
XSLT to create the 4 different views of this data:</p>

<p>Proxy C++ header</p>

<p>Proxy C++  body</p>

<p>Wrapper C++ header</p>

<p>Wrapper C++ body</p>



<p>So we prepopulate the DOM with parameter data that comes
from the XML files and then iterate through the Signatures that are returned
from the C++ header parser transferring the useful data into the DOM. </p>



<p>We than use 4 XSLT stylesheets to generate the C++ output
files as required. </p>
