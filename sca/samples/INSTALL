Building Tuscany SCA samples on Linux
=====================================

If using the binary distribution the samples are built and installed in
<tuscany_sca_install_dir>/samples

1. The following environment variables are required:
     TUSCANY_SCACPP=<path to installed Tuscany SCA>
     TUSCANY_SDOCPP=<path to installed Tuscany SDO>
     AXIS2C_HOME=<path to axis2c verion 0.92>
   
2. Build the source
     cd <samples_dir>
	 ./configure
	 make
	 make install

     NOTE: If you don't provide a --prefix configure option, it will by default install into
     /usr/local/tuscany/sca
