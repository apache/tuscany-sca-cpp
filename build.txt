Tuscany C++ Build Instructions for Developers
=============================================

Download the source from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/cpp
The download location is <tuscany_cpp_root>

Linux Build
===========

Prereqs:
- libxml2 (tested with version 2.6.19)
- Axis2C (version 0.92)

Environment:
- export LIBXML2_INCLUDE=<path to libxml2 headers. e.g. /usr/include/libxml2> 
- export LIBXML2_LIB=<path to libxml2 libraries. e.g. /usr/lib> 
- export AXIS2C_HOME=<axis2c_deploy>


Build:
- cd <tuscany_cpp_root>
- ./build.sh

This first builds the SDO subproject then SCA. The results are installed in
 <tuscany_cpp_root>/sdo/deploy
 <tuscany_cpp_root>/sca/deploy

SDO Test
--------

Run:
- cd <tuscany_cpp_root>/sdo
- ./sdotest.sh


SCA Test
--------

Run:
- cd <tuscany_cpp_root>/sca
- ./scatest.sh

Linux distribution build
========================
To build the distro zips for linux:

1. Download the source from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/cpp
The download location is <tuscany_cpp_root>

2. cd <tuscany_cpp_root>/sdo

3. set the environment
   - export LIBXML2_INCLUDE=<path to libxml2 headers. e.g. /usr/include/libxml2> 
   - export LIBXML2_LIB=<path to libxml2 libraries. e.g. /usr/lib> 
   - export AXIS2C_HOME=<axis2c_deploy>

4. ./makedist.sh
   This produces a src and bin zip for Tuscany SDO

5. cd <tuscany_cpp_root>/sca

6. set the environment
   - export TUSCANY_SDOCPP=<tuscany_cpp_root>/sdo/tucany_sdo-bin-${PACKAGE-VERSION}
   
7. ./makedist.sh
   This produces a src and bin zip for Tuscany SCA
   

Windows Build
=============

Microsoft Visual Studio 6.x projects are provided for building on Windows.

SDO
---

Prereqs:

- libxml2 (tested with version 2.6.19)
- Axis2C (version 0.92)

Set the following environment variables to point to the location of the dependencies:
        LIBXML2_INCLUDE=<libxml2 include location>
        LIBXML2_LIB=<libxml2 lib location>
        AXIS2C_HOME=<axis2c_deploy>

Open the build workspace tuscany\cpp\sdo\runtime\projects\tuscany_sdo\tuscany_sdo.dsw
and follow the build instructions.

Note for users of Microsoft Visual Studio 7.x
---------------------------------------------
You can convert the projects supplied to a solution for Studio 7 by opening them in VS 7.x and selecting to convert. There are a number of small differences between VC6 and VC7 which may require additional changes to get the SDO code to compile, link and run.

All the projects must be built multi-threaded: Project Properties/Configuration properties/C/C++/Code Generation/Runtime Library - select MultiThreaded Debug DLL /MDd  (for debug build).

The test project runs in the projects directory, where in C6 it ran in the Debug directory, so all the
test comparison files are in the wrong place. You can copy the entire contents of runtime/core/test/Debug to projects/tuscany_sdo/sdo_test



SCA
---

Set the environment variable TUSCANY_SDOCPP to the path of an SDO build

Open the build workspace tuscany\cpp\sca\projects\tuscany_sca\tuscany_sca.dsw 
and follow the instructions.
