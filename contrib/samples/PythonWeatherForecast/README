Tuscany SCA for C++ Samples - Weather Sample
============================================

This is a very simple sample to show how an SCA composite can wire together
two components to implement calls to a Weather Forecast web service

There are three sub projects in this workspace:
    - sample.weather
      This contains the source code and SCDL artifacts for the SCA Weather
      composite implementing the calls to the Weather web services.

    - sample.weather.client
      A sample client which does a local call to the SCA Weather service.


Additionally, there is the sample.weather.app.composite file. This 
describes the configuration of the SCA Weather composite deployed to the 
SCA runtime.

See the README.html file for instructions to build and run this sample
