Tuscany SCA for C++ Samples - REST Calculator Sample
===============================================

This is a very simple sample to show how to use the SCA REST binding to
expose a Calculator service as a REST service and invoke that service.

There are three sub projects in this workspace:
    - sample.calculator
      This contains the source code and SCDL artifacts for the SCA Calculator.
      composite implementing the sample Calculator.

    - sample.calculator.restclient
      A sample REST client which calls the Calculator service.

    - httpserver
      This contains a minimal configuration for the Apache HTTP server used
      to host the REST service as well as scripts to start and stop the server.

Additionally, there is the sample.calculator.app.composite file. This 
describes the configuration of the SCA Calculator composite deployed to the 
SCA runtime.

See the README.html file for instructions to build and run this sample
