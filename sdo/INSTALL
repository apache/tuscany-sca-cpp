Building Tuscany SDO on Linux.
==============================

1. Extract the source to a folder. 
2. You need to set the following two environment variables to point to libxml2. 
        LIBXML2_INCLUDE
        LIBXML2_LIB
If you are using the default installation of libxml2, usually those are
LIBXML2_LIB=/usr/lib
LIBXML2_INCLUDE=/usr/include/libxml2

3. Set the environment variable AXIS2C_HOME to the location of an installed Axis2C
   Verion 0.92
   
3. Build the source
	./build.sh

4. Run the test
    cd to runtime/core/test
    ./tuscany_sdo_test
