1. Prereqs
==========

Axis2C: Version 0.92 available from http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/download.cgi
Download and follow the installation instructions. Ensure you can run the Axis2C samples

libxml2: available from http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html
(NOTE: most Linux systems have libxml2 by default. On Windows you need to 
download and install libxml2. Axis2C 0.92 specifies version 2.6.20, and problems
have been seen with earlier versions, so we recommend this version)


2. Getting Tuscany SDO working with the binary release on Linux
===============================================================
a. Extract the binary tar package to a folder. 


3. Getting Tuscany SDO working with the source release on Linux
===============================================================
a. Extract the source tar package to a folder <tuscany_sdo> 
b. The following environment variables are required:
     LIBXML2_INCLUDE=<path to libxml2 includes>
     LIBXML2_LIB=<path to libxml2 lib>
        Note: If you are using the default installation of libxml2 these are usually:
        LIBXML2_LIB=/usr/lib
        LIBXML2_INCLUDE=/usr/include/libxml2

     AXIS2C_HOME=<path to axis2c version 0.92>
   
c. Build the source
	 ./configure
	 make
	 make install

     NOTE: If you don't provide a --prefix configure option, it will by default install into
     /usr/local/tuscany/sdo 
     
d. Run the test
     cd to <tuscany_sdo>/runtime/core/test
     ./tuscany_sdo_test


4. Getting Tuscany SDO working with the binary release on Windows
=================================================================
a. Unzip the supplied zip file.

b. Set the TUSCANY_SDOCPP environment variable to point to the directory that was just unzipped. 


5. Getting Tuscany SDO working with the source release on Windows
=================================================================
a. Unzip the source supplied zip file.
 
b. The following environment variables are required:
     LIBXML2_INCLUDE=<path to libxml2 includes>
     LIBXML2_LIB=<path to libxml2 lib>

     AXIS2C_HOME=<path to axis2c verion 0.92>
   
c. Build the source
   > cd <to where you unzipped the source>
   > build
  This will build all the projects and put the required output into the 'deploy' directory.


Alternatively, open the workspace tuscany_sdo.dsw in Visual Studio 6 - you can build projects individually
or build the test project to build all its dependencies. Running the test project should give a list of
tests passed - this is currently 111 tests, no failures.
