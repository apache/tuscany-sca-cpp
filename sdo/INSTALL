Building Tuscany SDO on Linux.
==============================

1. Extract the source to a folder. 
2. You need to set the following two environment variables to point to libxml2. 
        LIBXML2_INCLUDE
        LIBXML2_LIB
If you are using the default installation of libxml2, usually those are
LIBXML2_LIB=/usr/lib
LIBXML2_INCLUDE=/usr/include/libxml2

3. Build the source
This can be done using the following command sequence:
        autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make
        make install

4. Run the test
        cd to runtime/core/test
        ./tuscany_sdo_test
