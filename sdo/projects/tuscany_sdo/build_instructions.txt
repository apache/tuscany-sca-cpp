Tuscany SDO Build Instructions
===============================

The project is dependent on libxml 
(available here: http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html) 

The versions required are these:
	libxml2-2.6.19.win32
	iconv-1.9.1.win32
	zlib-1.2.2.win32

By default, the projects are set up to look for these in directories located by the 
environment variables: LIBXML2_HOME, ICONV_HOME and ZLIB_HOME. These need to be set 
before launching Visual Studio.

Open the build workspace tuscany\cpp\sdo\runtime\projects\tuscany_sdo\tuscany_sdo.dsw

Build->Set Active Configuration->sdo_runtime - Win32 Release

Build->Rebuild All

The output of the build will be in runtime\core\Release.

The executable, required headers and lib are copied to tuscany\cpp\sdo\bin, include and lib.


Note for users of Microsoft Visual Studio 7.x
---------------------------------------------
You can convert the projects supplied to a solution for Studio 7 by opening them in VS 7.x 
and selecting to convert. There are a number of small differences between VC6 and VC7 
which may require additional changes to get the SDO code to compile, link and run.

All the projects must be built multi-threaded: Project Properties/Configuration 
properties/C/C++/Code Generation/Runtime Library - select MultiThreaded Debug DLL /MDd  
(for debug build).

The test project runs in the projects directory, where in C6 it ran in the Debug directory, 
so all the test comparison files are in the wrong place. You can copy the entire contents 
of runtime/core/test/Debug to projects/tuscany_sdo/sdo_test
