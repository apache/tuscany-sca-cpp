Tuscany SDO Build Instructions
===============================

The project is dependent on libxml 
(available here: http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html) 

The versions required are these:
	libxml2-2.6.20.win32
	iconv-1.9.1.win32
	zlib-1.2.2.win32

By default, the projects are set up to look for these in directories located by the 
environment variables: LIBXML2_HOME, ICONV_HOME and ZLIB_HOME. These need to be set 
before launching Visual Studio.

The two projects sdo_axiom and sdo_axiom_test are dependent on AXIS2C, and require that
an environment variable AXIS2C_HOME be set to where axis2c is installed. Axis2c can be 
located at http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/. Please read the axis2c documentation to ensure
you have installed any pre-requisites.

Open the build workspace tuscany\cpp\sdo\runtime\projects\tuscany_sdo\tuscany_sdo.dsw

Build->Set Active Configuration->sdo_axiom_test - Win32 Release

Build->Rebuild All

The output of the build will be in runtime\core\Release.

The executable, required headers and lib are copied to the deploy directory.
