Tuscany SDO Build Instructions
===============================

The project is dependent on libxml 
(available here: http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html) 

The versions required are these:
	libxml2-2.6.20.win32
	iconv-1.9.1.win32
	zlib-1.2.2.win32

By default, the projects are set up to look for these in directories located by the 
environment variables: LIBXML2_HOME, ICONV_HOME and ZLIB_HOME. These need to be set 
before launching Visual Studio.

The two projects sdo_axiom and sdo_axiom_test are dependent on AXIS2C, and require that
an environment variable AXIS2C_HOME be set to where axis2c is installed. Axis2c can be 
located at http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/.

Open the build solution \sdo\runtime\projectsvc7\tuscany_sdo\tuscany_sdo.sln

Rebuild the solution

There are several signed-unsigned mismatches which we are working to fix, but these 
warnings should not cause any problems in running the project.

NOTE:
The output is copied to the deploy directory from both VC6 and VC7 builds.
