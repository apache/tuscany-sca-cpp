<h1>Overview</h1>

This package can be used to reflect across C++ source code. It can produce
a network of descriptive objects describing C++ Headers, Signatures, Parameters and so
on that it finds in a given location of the file system.
Each of the descriptive objects has a set of getters that return either 
the descriptive child objects, or for primitives, the string that represents the actual
value such as "int" or "myFunction".
<p>
There are also various utility methods that help with navigating the information, for example the Signature
class has an isConstructor method. The API Javadoc contains further details of these. 
<p>
The package can scan a directory using a file mask to identify what types
of files are to be scanned. In this application we are interested only 
in the function prototypes in the C++ header files. 
<p>
The implementation was originated using some java code that was also 
contributed to the Apache org.apache.axis.tools.common package. Care
has been taken that the original code was not sourced via Apache. If
this project is adopted by Apache then it is very possible that this 
package could be merged with or made obsolete by org.apache.axis.tools.common
and because of this the design and interfaces have been preserved from
the original code as much as possible.
