Tuscany SCA for C++ Samples - Alert Aggregator Sample
=====================================================

This is a sample that shows how a Web 2.0-style application can be built using
SCA. The Alert Aggregator Sample aggregates various data sources and presents 
a unified view of data from these sources, served as XML and displayed via a 
web page

There are three sub-directories in this workspace:
    - sample.alerter
      This contains the source code and SCDL artifacts for the Alert 
      Aggregator. Includes components to retrieve emails from POP servers and
      to retrieve items from RSS/Atom feeds, a component that aggregates these 
      alerts and a component that manages the configuration of which POP accounts
      and which RSS feeds to read.

    - sample.display
      Contains a single SCA component that provides a HTML display of the
      Alert Aggregator data

    - httpserver
      Configuration files and scripts to run the sample under Apache HTTPD. Also
      includes the HTML file that calls the HTMLDisplay component


Additionally, there is the sample.alerter.app.composite file. This 
describes the configuration of the Alerter and Display composites deployed to the 
SCA runtime.

This sample requires the following Tuscany extensions:
Python
REST service
REST reference

It also requires the Python FeedParser library, available from http://feedparser.org/
