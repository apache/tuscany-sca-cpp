Tuscany SCA for C++ Samples - REST Customer Sample
==================================================

This is a very simple sample to show how to use the SCA REST binding to
implement a resource management service and make resources available
through HTTP.

There are three sub projects in this workspace:
    - sample.customer
      This contains the source code and SCDL artifacts for the SCA component
      implementing the Customer resource management service.

    - sample.customer.restclient
      A sample REST client which shows how to create, update, retrieve, and
      delete Customer resources.

    - httpserver
      This contains a minimal configuration for the Apache HTTP server used
      to host the REST service as well as scripts to start and stop the server.

Additionally, there is the sample.customer.app.composite file. This 
describes the configuration of the SCA Calculator composite deployed to the 
SCA runtime.

See the README.html file for instructions to build and run this sample
