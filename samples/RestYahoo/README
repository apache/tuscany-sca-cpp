Tuscany SCA for C++ Samples - REST Yahoo Sample
===============================================

This is a very simple sample to show how to use the SCA REST binding to
invoke the Yahoo Web Search REST service.

There are two sub-projects in this workspace:
    - sample.yahoo
      This contains the SCDL artifacts and source code for the WebSearch 
      Component which calls a Reference that is configured to call the 
      Yahoo service 
    - sample.yahoo.client
      A Ruby client which calls the WebSearch component.

Additionally, there is the sample.yahoo.app.composite file. This 
describes the configuration of the SCA Yahoo Search composite deployed to 
the SCA runtime.

See the README.html file for instructions to build and run this sample
