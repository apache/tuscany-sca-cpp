This sample shows how to run the Bigbank app with the Apache HTTP server

This is a more modular version of the original Bigbank app, the account
service and the account data service are in different composites.

The httpserver directory contains a minimal httpd configuration.
Make sure that Apache apachectl and httpd 2.2.x are on the PATH.

To start the server, cd to httpserver, and run ./startserver.sh.

To verify that the server is working, point your Web browser to
http://localhost:9090.

To verify that Axis2C is working, point your Web browser to
http://localhost:9090/axis2, you should see a list of deployed services.

To stop the server, cd to httpserver, and run ./stopserver.sh.

To run the sample go to bigbank.wsclient, and run ./runwsclient.sh.
