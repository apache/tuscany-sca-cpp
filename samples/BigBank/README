Tuscany SCA for C++ Samples - BigBank Sample
===============================================

This sample implements the "Simplified BigBank" scenario. A whitepaper 
describing the scenario based on the SCA 0.9 Assembly specification can be 
found here. This sample uses multiple C++ components, calls out to an 
external Web Service via a reference, exposes the service as a Web Service 
and also provides a PHP based client.

There are five sub projects in this workspace:
    - bigbank.account
      This contains the source code and SCDL artifacts for the SCA BigBank 
      composite implementing the account services.

    - bigbank.accountmanagement
      This contains the SCDL file describing the configuration of the SCA 
      BigBank composite deployed to the SCA runtime.

    - bigbank.client
      A sample client which does a local call to the BigBank service.

    - bigbank.wsclient
      A sample Axis2 Web Service client which calls the BigBank Web service.

    - bigbank.phpclient
      A sample PHP client which calls the BigBank Web service and then 
      deconstructs and displays the result by using the SDO for PHP extension.

See the README.html file for instructions to build and run this sample
