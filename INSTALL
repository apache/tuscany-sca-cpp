2. Getting Tuscany SCA working with the binary release on Linux
===============================================================

a. Extract the binary tar package to a folder. 


3. Getting Tuscany SCA working with the source release on Linux
===============================================================

a. Extract the source tar package to a folder <tuscany_sca> 

b. The following environment variables are required:
     TUSCANY_SDOCPP=<path to installed Tuscany SDO>
     AXIS2C_HOME=<path to axis2c verion 0.92>
   
c. Build the source
	 ./configure
	 make
	 make install

   NOTE: If you don't provide a --prefix configure option, it will by default 
   install into /usr/local/tuscany/sca 


4. Working with the samples on Linux
====================================

The samples are installed in <install_prefix>/samples. To build and run the 
sample see the INSTALL documentation in the samples folder.


5. Getting Tuscany SCA working with the binary release on Windows
=================================================================

a. Unzip the supplied zip file.

b. Set the TUSCANY_SCACPP environment variable to point to the 
   tuscany_sca_cpp-0.1.incubating-M1-bin directory that was just unzipped. 


6. Getting Tuscany SCA working with the source release on Windows
=================================================================

a. Unzip the supplied zip file 

b. The following environment variables are required:
     TUSCANY_SDOCPP=<path to installed Tuscany SDO>
     AXIS2C_HOME=<path to axis2c verion 0.92>
   
c. Build the source
   The build.cmd file in the projects/tuscany_sca will build and install the 
   sca code to the 'deploy' directory.
   Note that it assumes the SDO installation is identified already by the 
   TUSCANY_SDOCPP variable.

Alternatively - open the tuscany_sca workspace in Visual Studio 6. You can 
build projects individually or build the samples to rebuild all the projects.


7. Working with the samples on Windows
======================================

The samples are installed in <install_prefix>/samples. To build and run the 
sample see the INSTALL documentation in the samples folder.
