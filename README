Apache Tuscany C++ M1 build (July, 2006)
===================================

http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany

Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation
(ASF), sponsored by the Web Services PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.


Getting Started
===============

Documentation describing the system requirements and the steps to install
Tuscany SCA C++ and run the samples can be found in the GettingStarted.html file.


About Tuscany SCA C++
=====================

Tuscany SCA C++ provides a runtime implementation for the Service Component
Architecture 0.9 specification, written in C++ and will currently support C++
component implementation types. 

It is possible to interoperate with Tuscany SCA Java via the Web Service bindings
for EntryPoint/ExternalService but restrictions apply. This is not yet a complete
implementation and known restrictions are described below.

Supported SCA Assembly Model features
  *  All features are supported unless listed under the known restrictions
     below. See SCA Assembly Model specification.

Supported language bindings
  * Component implementations written in C++. See SCA Client and
    Implementation Model specification.
  * Component interfaces described by C++ classes. See SCA Client and
    Implementation Model specification.

Supported external service and entry point bindings
  * The web service binding is supported. This implementation will support
    web services which using document literal SOAP bindings conforming to the
    WS-I basic profile (rpc/encoded is not yet supported).

Known restrictions
  * Subsystem wiring, entry points and external services are not supported.
  * Local service interfaces cannot use overloaded operations (the SCA
    specification limits remote service interfaces to not using overloaded
	operations).
  * Each WSDL definition for a web service binding must be in a single WSDL
    document.
  * No load time validation of the deployed SCA application (run time validation
    only).
  * No metadata API.
  * A Web Service EntryPoint that is wired (via zero or more components) to a 
    Web Service ExternalService will fail when attempting to send the final 
    response to the originating client. 



Thank you for using Tuscany!
