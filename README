Apache Tuscany C++ M2 build (October, 2006)
===========================================

http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany

Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation
(ASF), sponsored by the Web Services PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.


Getting Started
===============

Documentation describing the system requirements and the steps to install
Tuscany SCA C++ and run the samples can be found in the GettingStarted.html 
file.


About Tuscany SCA C++
=====================

Tuscany SCA C++ provides a runtime implementation for the for the Service 
Component Architecture 0.96 Assembly specification and the 0.95 C++ Client 
& Implementation Model specification, written in C++ and will currently 
support C++, Python and Ruby component implementation types.

The specifications can be found at
http://www.osoa.org/display/Main/Service+Component+Architecture+Specifications 

It is possible to interoperate with Tuscany SCA Java via the Web Service bindings
for services and references but restrictions apply. This is not yet a complete
implementation and known restrictions are described below.

Supported SCA Assembly Model features
  *  All features are supported unless listed under the known restrictions
     below. See SCA Assembly Model specification.

Supported language bindings
  * Component implementations written in C++. See the SCA C++ Client and 
    Implementation Model specification.
  * Component implementations written in Python. See the doc/PythonExtension.html 
    documentation.
  * Component implementations written in Python. See the doc/RubyExtension.html 
    documentation.
  * Component interfaces described by C++ classes. See SCA Client and
    Implementation Model specification.

Supported service and reference bindings
  * The web service binding is supported. This implementation will support
    web services which using document literal SOAP bindings conforming to the
    WS-I basic profile (rpc/encoded is not yet supported).

Known restrictions
  * Local service interfaces cannot use overloaded operations (the SCA
    specification limits remote service interfaces to not using overloaded
    operations).
  * Each WSDL definition for a web service binding must be in a single WSDL
    document.
  * No load time validation of the deployed SCA application (run time 
    validation only).
  * No metadata API. 



Thank you for using Tuscany!
